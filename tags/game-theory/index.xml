      <title>Contracts Federated Cloud</title>

      <description>Overview We develop a new contracts-based resource sharing model for federated geo-distributed clouds that allows cloud service providers to establish contractual relationships with individual datacenters for defined time intervals. Based on the established contracts, individual cloud service providers employ a cost-aware job scheduling and provisioning algorithm that enables tasks to complete and meet their response time requirements.
What is the challenge?  How to decide Resource Sharing Contracts guaranteeing both Fairness and Efficiency?</description>

      <description>Overview In the Internet of Things(IoT) era, the demands for low-latency computing for time-sensitive applications (e.g., location-based augmented reality games, real-time smart grid management, real-time navigation using wearables) has been growing rapidly. Edge Computing provides an additional layer of infrastructure to fill latency gaps between IoT devices and the backend computing infrastructure.
Zenith decouples resource allocation and service provisioning and management at the edge and provides a novel model to allocate resources at the edge to maximize utility.</description>
